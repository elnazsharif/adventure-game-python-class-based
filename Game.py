"""
    This class is the main class of the "Adventure World" application. 
    'Adventure World' is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users 
    can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
    to make it more interesting!
    
    To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
    method.

    This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
    rooms, creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates and
    executes the commands that the parser returns.
    
    This game is adapted from the 'World of Zuul' by Michael Kolling
    and David J. Barnes. The original was written in Java and has been
    simplified and converted to Python by Kingsley Sage.
